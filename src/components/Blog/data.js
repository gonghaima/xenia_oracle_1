This is not true. The process starts well before a trip is planned and lasts long after they have returned home. Looking back at the five stages of travel they are still relevant today, maybe even more so, when we are all vying for the tourist\u00a0dollar.</p>\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/414/1*RuvilLwBuAcP2t2Gt-QkQQ.png"></figure><p>In this post we will unpack the five stages and what you can do to give your property the best advantage. It starts with a dream that is planned, booked, experienced, and\u00a0shared.</p>\n<h3>STAGE ONE:\u00a0DREAMING</h3>\n<p>Every holiday starts with a dream. When it comes to brightening our daily lives, travel is the stuff that daydreams are made of. In fact, even in the midst of a global pandemic, more than 60% of people are thinking about planning their next holiday at least once a month\u200a\u2014\u200aand 92.1% of American travellers are looking to take at least one trip in the next 12-months.</p>\n<p>This is an opportunity to inspire them, focusing all their attention on your property and making it easy for them to move from \u201cwhat if\u2026?\u201d to booking. This requires more than facts about room rates and amenities. You need to create an experience that defines the dream through compelling storytelling of who you are and what makes your property like no\u00a0other.</p>\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*iTRgwC4CIwVBAPAd"></figure><p>In our current environment, people have unprecedented control of what, when, how, and where they get information and are less likely to click into/respond to advertising. People are looking for content that entertains, informs, and creates a connection/emotional response. Some ideas we have found to be successful include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Videos to enable future guests to view their experience virtually</li>\n<li>Friendly and conversational posts to share location insights, promote local partners/businesses in your area, upcoming\u00a0events</li>\n<li>Writing and/or sharing content that highlights authentic experiences and people in your\u00a0area</li>\n<li>Using SEO measurement tools to learn what is and connecting and what\u2019s\u00a0not</li>\n<li>Building your social media community to share visitor experiences and\u00a0photos.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Quick Tip:</strong> <em>Over half of video content is consumed on mobile devices and this will only continue to increase. If your videos aren\u2019t optimised for smartphones, you may be missing out on getting your property in front of future\u00a0guests.</em></p>\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*WU6DqCNrcI4nmC2d"></figure><h3>STAGE TWO:\u00a0PLANNING</h3>\n<p>Many travellers remain in the dreaming phase for quite some time, while others may emerge from the initial stage in the travel consumer journey and set themselves on the path to purchase rather quickly. Either way, then need to move on to the planning stage before\u00a0booking.</p>\n<p>Through your efforts, your future guest has moved from dreaming of a holiday somewhere to focusing on your area and more importantly your property. Now they are starting to consider when, how long, how to get there, and what they will do while there. The key is to understand who your guests are, why are they travelling (leisure/business), and types of experiences that they will be looking\u00a0for.</p>\n<p>However, the job is not done. Before making a booking, travellers take time to research all the possibilities. According to Google, 70% of travellers research travel on their smartphone and 66% of travelers say they bounce back and forth between dreaming about and planning their next trip\u200a\u2014\u200azooming in on the details for one destination and then zooming out to reconsider all the options\u00a0again.</p>\n<p>The cyclical nature of this activity means that you need to stay visible at all times. In fact, over the course of the guest\u2019s travel cycle, it is likely that they will have visited over 20 different travel websites in over 9 separate research sessions on the internet. According to Statista, 55% of travellers believe they must review many travel resources before\u00a0booking.</p>\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*w0lHmQBzsyBxxqkh"></figure><p><strong>Quick Tip:</strong> <em>Your website is your most important channel during the planning stage and Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) can help you get ahead of your competition and help ensure that you\u2019re noticed. According to Skift, almost half of travel companies revenue can be traced back to organic search. Your property needs to be easily found when future guests are looking for places to stay in your\u00a0area.</em></p>\n<h3>STAGE THREE:\u00a0BOOKING</h3>\n<p>You are almost there, at this stage your future guest is more than just interested, they are motivated but they could just as easily pull out and go somewhere else. The key is to make the transition from planning to booking as smooth and as seamless as possible. As we know, people are busier than ever before, by removing any barriers for booking and adding any special offers, may entice them to take\u00a0action.</p>\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*XxUVC8GYwgcSHrwV"></figure><p>According to Travel Daily News, two-thirds of the travel market (66%) book their travel online, with only 24.3% opting to use travel agencies to provide them with a holiday booking service. This means that you need to ensure your website offers clear information on pricing and availability and make it easy for your future guests to ask questions.</p>\n<p>People are looking more and more to creating experiences and the more you can help them plan for all elements of their journey could the difference between your property and one down the road. Supporting this, research has indicated that websites offering customers \u2018a one-stop shop\u2019 are expected to own almost half of the online digital travel market by\u00a02022.</p>\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*w4ltA8Gw26_88W9p"></figure><p><strong>Quick Tip:</strong> <em>We are becoming more and more reliant on our mobile phones. Some of your customers don\u2019t want to wait until they have access to a computer, so it needs to be easy to book through mobile\u00a0devices.</em></p>\n<h3>STAGE FOUR: EXPERIENCE</h3>\n<p>This is it, your guest experience will determine whether they come again and encourage others to do so. When the actual experience meets or exceeds the expectations that\u2019s when you build trust and create repeat visitors. People can make the biggest difference to your guest experience through genuine and authentic connections. One of the best ways to supplement their experience is to provide something tangible and memorable. These offerings include but are not limited\u00a0to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Curated itineraries</li>\n<li>A travel guide full of your local recommendations.</li>\n<li>Personalised communication, including special offers and discounts</li>\n</ol>\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*nrpYDN_s_uxvdTHO"></figure><h3>How Xenia Suite can\u00a0help:</h3>\n<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xeniasuite.xeniaguestii&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US">Xenia Suite\u2019s Guest App</a> can help you deliver the ultimate experience by empowering guests before they\u2019ve even stepped into your hotel. Some of the key features\u00a0include:</p>\n<h3>Pre-Arrival</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Allowing guests to easily make and sync upcoming\u00a0bookings</li>\n<li>Selecting room types from preferences</li>\n<li>Personalised communication, including special offers and discounts</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>During their\u00a0Stay</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Personalised contactless check-in and keyless room\u00a0entry</li>\n<li>View local area information, local events, hotel amenities, and additional services (parking information, spa treatments, movies, laundry, housekeeping etc.)</li>\n<li>Real-time communication with staff via chat, email, phone, and\u00a0more</li>\n<li>Order room service, mini-bar management, and restaurant bookings</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>After Departing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Contactless checkout</li>\n<li>Process final\u00a0payments</li>\n<li>Personalised post-stay follow-up</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Quick Tip: Unless you run a very small operation, the role of customer satisfaction will come down to your employees. They will need to be trained to deliver the exact experience you and your customers are expecting.</p>\n<h3>STAGE FIVE:\u00a0SHARING</h3>\n<p>Most people book accommodation on recommendations from friends and family. In the past showing photos of their trip was to a small select group, these days a photo or video can be shared around the world through social media. Treat them right and your guests will become an ambassador for your\u00a0brand.</p>\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*c6eN_xHbjYfqa1jx"></figure><p>Capturing guest reviews from those who have had an overwhelmingly positive experience is key to maintaining both a 5-star presence online and a successful business. Additionally, their positive time on the property and with your business influences their next getaway! However, it\u2019s imperative you create some form of re-engagement to further keep them involved in your\u00a0brand.</p>\n<h3>How to Help Guests Remember\u00a0You</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Implement an effective email marketing strategy and remarked to previous\u00a0guests</li>\n<li>Set up guest lifestyle campaigns in your marketing efforts</li>\n<li>Try to obtain as many 5-star reviews as you\u00a0can</li>\n<li>Respond to all guest feedback and\u00a0review</li>\n<li>Use creative, strategic thinking when crafting social media posts and your presence on social\u00a0media.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Quick Tip:</strong> <em>Respond to reviews. Future guests will make decisions based on how you have responded to a review. Previous guests can give you a wealth of information regarding what they liked and didn\u2019t like about their experience. Use these reviews as a learning process, double down on the good and eliminate the\u00a0bad.</em></p>\n<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>\n<p>It is important to target each one of the five stages of travel to ensure your brand is with them along their journey, you\u2019ll stand out from your competitors by enabling your customers to share their experience with their extended peer network. Focusing only on some of the stages could see you missing out on a future guest and/or repeat bookings.</p>\n<img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=5a8fa6a47023" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr>\n<p><a href="https://medium.com/xeniasuite/the-5-stages-of-travel-how-to-influence-travel-decisions-and-maximise-your-hotels-marketing-5a8fa6a47023">The 5 Stages of Travel: How to influence travel decisions and maximise your hotel\u2019s marketing\u2026</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/xeniasuite">xeniasuite</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>\n',

        '\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*heBgu1doPO8IQvmD9583fQ.jpeg"></figure><p>In 2023 hotels are facing more competition than ever before. With shifting consumer demands and the rise of online travel agencies (OTAs) like Expedia, Booking.com, and Hotels.com, it can be a challenge for hotels to attract and retain customers. But don\u2019t worry, with the right strategy, your hotel can increase direct bookings and avoid paying high commission fees to\u00a0OTAs.</p>\n<h3>User-Friendly Website</h3>\n<p>One of the best ways to boost direct bookings is by having a user-friendly and visually appealing website. A website that\u2019s easy to navigate, quick to load, and optimized for search engines will make it more likely for potential customers to book directly with your hotel. Also, by including high-quality photos and videos of your hotel\u2019s rooms, facilities, and surroundings, you can help customers envision their stay and make a booking decision.</p>\n<h3>Exclusive Deals</h3>\n<p>Another great strategy is to offer exclusive deals and promotions to customers who book directly with your hotel. This could be things like discounted room rates, complimentary breakfast, or late check-out. By offering these incentives, you can encourage customers to book directly and avoid the high commission fees charged by\u00a0OTAs.</p>\n<h3>Incentivising Loyalty</h3>\n<p>Linked to this is direct marketing activity that looks to re-engage past customers. Your past guests are a gold mine when it comes to rebooking. Re-engage past customers using an email marketing campaign with compelling discounts and offers. Also, if you don\u2019t have one, consider launching a loyalty program. Travellers respond well to these programs, and you\u2019ll learn much more about your best guest profiles. Your loyalty programs don\u2019t have to be complicated, with points and redemptions\u200a\u2014\u200ait could be as simple as promising \u201cMembers Only\u201d\u00a0rates.</p>\n<h3>Social Media</h3>\n<p>Social media is also a powerful tool that hotels can use to increase direct bookings. By having a presence on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, hotels can connect with potential customers, share information about their hotel, and offer promotions and deals. Additionally, by leveraging user-generated content, hotels can showcase positive reviews and experiences of their guests which can help build trust and credibility.</p>\n<h3>Personalise the guest experience</h3>\n<p>Guest profiles within PMS systems like <a href="https://www.xeniasuite.co.nz/">Xenia Suite</a> can contain detailed information, such as birthdays, anniversaries, and special requests. You can use this information with guest messaging software to build guest relationships and offer personalized services, special discounts, and deals during their\u00a0stay.</p>\n<p>For instance, say one of your guests recently visited your property for an anniversary trip, and they noted that they have an allergy to something like gluten. Imagine the guest\u2019s reaction if you send them a personalised direct message (possible through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=golq8LGkaKg">Xenia Suite\u2019s Guest App</a>) informing them that your restaurant has recently expanded its gluten-free options and are offering their room at a discounted rate for their upcoming anniversary. Personalised service creates lasting customer loyalty and encourages repeat visits and direct bookings. Better yet, you can get started start away with Xenia Suite\u2019s end-to-end hotel software.</p>\n<a href="https://medium.com/media/c60b92a7cd25e50c5fa86b016fad3f61/href">https://medium.com/media/c60b92a7cd25e50c5fa86b016fad3f61/href</a><p>By implementing these strategies, your hotel can increase direct bookings and avoid paying high commission fees to OTAs.

When guests are impressed by their stay, they are more likely to return and recommend your hotel to others. The goal for any hotel is to have guests become brand ambassadors, recommending your hotel to their friends and family. This helps to attract new business and improve overall profitability.</li>\n<li>Secondly, positive online reviews are essential for any business in the current digital age. Guests who have had a great experience are more likely to leave glowing reviews on platforms like TripAdvisor and Yelp. This helps to boost your hotel\u2019s reputation and attract new guests, thereby increasing profitability.</li>\n<li>In addition to increased revenue and positive online reviews, a great guest experience can also result in cost savings for your hotel. When guests have a positive experience, they are less likely to complain or request refunds, which can be time-consuming and costly for your hotel. By providing excellent service and ensuring guest satisfaction, hotels can minimize the need for these interventions, ultimately saving money and increasing profitability.</li>\n<li>Finally, providing an exceptional guest experience creates more opportunities for upselling. Guests who are impressed with their stay are more likely to take advantage of additional services and amenities offered by your hotel, leading to increased revenue per guest and higher overall profit for your\u00a0hotel.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>At <a href="http://www.xeniasuite.co.nz/">Xenia Suite</a>, we believe that providing a great guest experience is not only essential for guest satisfaction but is also directly linked to maximizing profitability.

When guests are impressed by their stay, they are more likely to return and recommend your hotel to others. The goal for any hotel is to have guests become brand ambassadors, recommending your hotel to their friends and family. This helps to attract new business and improve overall profitability.</li>\n<li>Secondly, positive online reviews are essential for any business in the current digital age. Guests who have had a great experience are more likely to leave glowing reviews on platforms like TripAdvisor and Yelp. This helps to boost your hotel\u2019s reputation and attract new guests, thereby increasing profitability.</li>\n<li>In addition to increased revenue and positive online reviews, a great guest experience can also result in cost savings for your hotel. When guests have a positive experience, they are less likely to complain or request refunds, which can be time-consuming and costly for your hotel. By providing excellent service and ensuring guest satisfaction, hotels can minimize the need for these interventions, ultimately saving money and increasing profitability.</li>\n<li>Finally, providing an exceptional guest experience creates more opportunities for upselling. Guests who are impressed with their stay are more likely to take advantage of additional services and amenities offered by your hotel, leading to increased revenue per guest and higher overall profit for your\u00a0hotel.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>At <a href="http://www.xeniasuite.co.nz/">Xenia Suite</a>, we believe that providing a great guest experience is not only essential for guest satisfaction but is also directly linked to maximizing profitability.

Hotels are increasingly aware of the need to reduce their environmental impact and operate in a more sustainable way. If you\u2019re a hotel owner or manager looking to make your hotel more sustainable, here are five things you can\u00a0do:</p>\n<h3>Reduce Energy Consumption</h3>\n<p>One of the biggest ways hotels can reduce their environmental impact is by reducing energy consumption. This can be achieved by switching to energy-efficient lighting, installing occupancy sensors to turn off lights and air conditioning when rooms are empty, and encouraging guests to reuse towels and sheets to reduce water\u00a0usage.</p>\n<h3>Implement Waste Management Practices</h3>\n<p>Another way hotels can be more sustainable is by implementing waste management practices. This includes recycling programs for guests and staff, using biodegradable cleaning products, and composting food waste. Proper waste management not only helps reduce environmental impact but can also save on waste disposal\u00a0costs.</p>\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*fvcAL6eJzk1VpQ4sozKTVw.png"></figure><h3>Use Sustainable Products</h3>\n<p>Using sustainable products can be another way for hotels to reduce their environmental impact. This can include using refillable amenity dispensers instead of single-use bottles, using sustainable materials for furniture and decor, and providing guests with reusable water bottles instead of plastic\u00a0ones.</p>\n<h3>Partner with Local Businesses</h3>\n<p>Partnering with local businesses can be a great way for hotels to support the local community and reduce their environmental impact. This can include sourcing food and supplies from local vendors, offering tours and activities that showcase the local area, and partnering with environmental organizations to support local conservation efforts.</p>\n<h3>Utilise Hotel PMS\u00a0Software</h3>\n<p>Hotel PMS software like <a href="https://www.xeniasuite.co.nz/">Xenia Suite</a> can help hotels become more sustainable by using technology to streamline operations and reduce waste by facilitating energy and water usage tracking, implementing waste management practices, and reducing paper usage through electronic check-in and guest communications.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, there are many ways for hotels to become more sustainable, from reducing energy consumption to partnering with local businesses and utilizing technology like hotel PMS software.

The reality is, there is a potentially endless number of things you could choose to post about on social media, and knowing where to get started can be difficult. In this article, we\u2019re going to focus on what makes a good post, the benefits of using content pillars, and when you should be\u00a0posting.</p>\n<h3>Focus on the\u00a0\u2018why\u2019</h3>\n<p>There is a potentially endless number of things you could choose to post about on social media and knowing where to get started can be difficult. An easy first step is to refer to what we talked about in the \u2018Get to know your audience\u2019 section\u200a\u2014\u200atheir motivations and pain points. If you have a clear understanding of what your hotel guests are looking for from your hotel (and also what they would rather not see from you) you\u2019ll have a good idea of how to stand out. Using social media as a business is all about providing value to your potential customers.</p>\n<p>Give potential guests a reason to book with you. They\u2019re searching for an experience, so post content that captures the essence of your hotel. Share photos of people enjoying themselves, and the service your hotel provides. Give people an idea of what their rooms look like, the services your hotel provides that guests can enjoy (a pool or spa to relax in, a restaurant to indulge at, or a play area for children to be entertained in), and an idea of the surrounding area. And remember\u200a\u2014\u200athe old adage of \u2018show don\u2019t tell\u2019 rings true here, post as many comments and photos from guests as possible as potential customers are more likely to trust the word of your guests than anything\u00a0else.</p>\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*nVOaiBk8aTVsLs0u"></figure><h3>Content Pillars</h3>\n<p>Having consistent, relevant, and engaging content on your social media channels is crucial and you should also always keep your target audience in mind. Content pillars are a great way of achieving this. The concept of \u2018\u2019content pillars\u2019 is based around the idea of building your social media content plan around a number of key topics (usually between 4\u20136) that work in tandem to market your hotel. They\u2019re a useful way of \u2018covering your bases\u2019 while ensuring that the content you create is tailored to appeal to your target customers.</p>\n<p>So which pillars should you choose? Because every hotel is different, your content pillars are likely to be different as well. They should be based on the audience you\u2019re trying to attract, the location you\u2019re based in, and the unique services and amenities that your hotel\u00a0offers.</p>\n<h3>A simple approach could\u00a0be:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Rooms (everyone stays in one so it\u2019s a must-have pillar)</li>\n<li>Amenities (pools, restaurant, etc)</li>\n<li>Special Occasions (Weddings, Honeymoons, etc)</li>\n<li>Business (conferences, meeting\u00a0rooms)</li>\n<li>Destination (what attracts people to the area that you\u2019re\u00a0based)</li>\n<li>Guests (what they enjoy at your hotel and their positive comments)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>At this point, you\u2019ll want to envision an individual guest for each pillar. What motivates them? Why would they want to stay with you? What is the problem that they are trying to solve? What do they need to\u00a0know?</p>\n<p>By answering these questions you\u2019ll be able to create a series of audience personas (think traveller on business, a family during school holidays, a honeymooning couple). Now that you know what the audience looks like for each content pillar, you can get to work creating content to appeal to\u00a0them.</p>\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*IQ4mpAAvnNf61cm2"></figure><h3>Creating content for your\u00a0pillars</h3>\n<p>We\u2019ve previously mentioned the importance of planning your content in advance, and the best way to do so while utilising content pillars is by visualising it as an editorial calendar. While there are a number of free or low-cost tools that can help you with doing so, an easy place to start is with something as simple as an Excel Spreadsheet or Google Sheet. Create a weekly or monthly calendar (there should be a template that you can use) and add content into the calendar that is colour-coded against your content pillars. This will provide you with a bird\u2019s eye view of what you\u2019re posting about in a given week or month and ensure that you\u2019re giving each audience type a fair share of promotion.</p>\n<h3>Demanding attention</h3>\n<p>It may sound obvious but posting eye-catching content\u200a\u2014\u200aespecially on visually weighted platforms like Instagram\u200a\u2014\u200ais an absolute must. There is a lot of competition for people\u2019s attention so make sure that your content demands it. Potential guests are looking for an experience and to be inspired, so make sure that you deliver that. It certainly helps to get creative with the content you create\u200a\u2014\u200avariety is the spice of life after all. You want guests to engage with what you post, otherwise, your time and effort is\u00a0wasted.</p>\n<h3>It\u2019s more than just the\u00a0room</h3>\n<p>Approximately 20% of travellers turn to social media for inspiration within different categories of travel planning, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Destinations: 27%</li>\n<li>Hotels: 23%</li>\n<li>Vacation activities: 22%</li>\n<li>Attractions: 21%</li>\n<li>Restaurants: 17%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A recent survey found that the main reason guests contact hotels on social media is for local information, so by providing travellers with inspiration and tips about the area you\u2019re situated in, you\u2019re demonstrating that your interest in them doesn\u2019t disappear the minute a guest steps foot outside your lobby. You\u2019re also connecting yourself to your wider community and this can have a positive and reciprocal flow-on\u00a0effect.</p>\n<h3>Be there with your guests every step of the\u00a0way</h3>\n<p>Hotel guests don\u2019t wait until they walk into your hotel to start using social media, and as such, you have an opportunity to build a relationship with them before they\u2019ve even entered the lobby. For example, your social media page might act as a useful point of reference for travellers, so make sure that all the information they might require is visible (for example special events happening this week, hotel amenities, the hotel restaurant menu). And make sure you\u2019re responsive and any all queries that a guest has before arriving.</p>\n<p>During their stay, you can pay attention to details that might explain why your hotel guest is staying with you or choosing you over your competition. You might uncover an opportunity to make someone\u2019s stay extra special (think people celebrating special occasions like birthdays or weddings, families who might require things like extra towels, or business travellers who might like to be made aware of amenities that are relevant to\u00a0them).</p>\n<p>Lastly, how you treat your guests once they depart can influence where they\u200a\u2014\u200aand others\u200a\u2014\u200astay in the future. Respond to all guest reviews and feedback\u200a\u2014\u200aand make sure that you thank people for any positive comments. If guests post something like a picture of their stay at your hotel, make sure to like it. According to Iconosquare, 76% of Instagrammers said receiving likes encourages them to post more, while 65% said they\u2019d feel flattered if a brand liked one of their\u00a0posts.</p>\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*zcBhgbO2J7s2A2mY"></figure><h3>Keep it\u00a0simple</h3>\n<p>Lastly, we all know that the hotel industry can be demanding on your time and many of you will not have the time to craft lengthy social media posts. As such, start simple and start small, focusing first on these three\u00a0things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Posts that highlight your hotel and the benefits of staying there. A beautiful image with a short caption on the benefits of your property should do the trick, especially if they can be shared with any special offers you may be running\u00a0too.</li>\n<li>Share upcoming events or attractions taking place at your hotel or local area. Remember\u200a\u2014\u200aa guests stay is about more than just their room, so share images of local attractions or events taking\u00a0place</li>\n<li>Share travel tips, especially if they\u2019re seasonal or specific to your area. Remember, as a business, social media is about adding value to your current and prospective customers.</li>\n<li>Be conversational. People love sharing their opinions, especially on topics that they\u2019re heavily invested in (like travel). By asking questions on topics like people\u2019s favourite thing about the hotel or attraction in your local area you\u2019re taking the first step to building a loyal community.</li>\n<li>Introduce the team. Guest interactions with staff are often as important to them as their room or your hotel\u2019s amenities. By sharing some \u2018meet the team\u2019 posts you can build familiarity and rapport with people while establishing your personality, and potentially even highlighting the services and amenities you offer in the\u00a0process.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The key thing here is to be consistent and be creative. Don\u2019t be afraid to experiment. Not every post will \u2018go viral\u2019, but don\u2019t expect it to. Instead, keep an eye on the kinds of content that consistently performs well and over time you\u2019ll build up a bit of a playbook for what works best for your\u00a0hotel.</p>\n<h3>In summary:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Know your audience and focus on the\u00a0\u2018why\u2019</li>\n<li>Keep things simple, eye-catching, and consistent</li>\n<li>Publish quality content that adds value to your audience and don\u2019t be too\u00a0\u2018salesy\u2019</li>\n<li>Create audience personas based on the unique features of your hotel and the area that you\u2019re situated\u00a0in</li>\n<li>Create content pillars and create an editorial calendar to help you get organised</li>\n</ol>\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*GOlrfJZdgOj6MCeD"></figure><h3>Twelve ideas to get you started\u00a0with:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Write a blog that makes some recommendations for travellers on where to eat, what to see, what they\u2019ll need to pack, or what events they should know about in your local area.
